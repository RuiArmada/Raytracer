# Raytracer
Raytracer developed for a Visualization and Lighting course. It implements a phyisically-based shader, capable of rendering scenes exported out of Blender.

## How to Run:

* For easy use it's advised to install [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=windows)
* Use the Build Function to compile everything. Otherwise run the `run.sh` script for easy use on linux
* Run `./vi-rt models/*.json` to generate a output image of the model as long as there's a `.json` file of it
